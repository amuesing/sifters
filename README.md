# __Sifters__
Sifters is a 'Data Synthesizer' used for developing musical compositions that makes use of logical sieves as the point of departure for creative processes. My goal in coding Sifters has been to create a system for synthesizing data to generate musical forms that are derived from a single logical source. The mechanism which holds that logic is called a 'sieve' and is it's use to derive musical materials is a concept I inherited from my analysis of the score to <i>Psappha</i> (1975) by Iannis Xenakis.

The logical sieve behaves in a way that is similar to an oscillator from a traditional analogue synthesizer configuration. Sifters is designed to output MIDI, Scala, and Wav files which can then be incorporated into a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). For convenience I have configured Sifters around both Ableton Liveâ€™s use of MIDI clips and Serum: Advanced Wavetable Synthesizer's use of WAV files in the construction of wavetables.
