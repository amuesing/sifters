The Composition class is a tool for creating music compositions based on a set of sieve intervals. It allows the user to pass in a set of sieve intervals as an argument to the constructor and generate a MIDI file of the composition based on a Music21 Part object. The Composition class has several methods available for use, including get_binary, which takes in a set of sieve intervals and returns a list of binary arrays representing those intervals, and get_factors, which takes in a number and returns a list of its factors. Other methods include construct_score, which creates a MIDI file of the composition based on a Music21 Part object, and set_measure_zero, which takes in a Music21 Score object and sets the starting measure to 0. Overall, the Composition class provides a convenient way to generate music compositions based on sieve intervals and create MIDI files of those compositions.
