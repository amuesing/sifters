# Sifters: A Data Synthesizer for Musical Composition

Sifters is a data-driven system for developing musical compositions, using logical sieves as the foundation for creative exploration. The core idea behind Sifters is to synthesize data that generates musical forms, all derived from a single logical source. This approach draws inspiration from Iannis Xenakisâ€™ analysis of Psappha (1975), where logical sieves are used to determine rhythmic and structural elements. In this system, the sieve functions similarly to an oscillator in an analog synthesizer, guiding the generation of musical material.

The commit history in this repository chronicles my ongoing exploration of logic-based operations applied to musical composition within the Python programming environment. Each sub-directory within the sifters directory corresponds to a unique track intended to be realized through Ableton.
