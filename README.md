# Sifters

Sifters is a 'Data Synthesizer' used for developing musical compositions that makes use of logical sieves as the point of departure for creative processes. My goal in coding Sifters has been to create a system for synthesizing data to generate musical forms that are derived from a single logical source. The mechanism which holds that logic is called a 'sieve', and its use to derive musical materials is a concept inherited from the analysis of the score to *Psappha* (1975) by Iannis Xenakis.

The logical sieve behaves in a way that is similar to an oscillator from a traditional analogue synthesizer configuration. Sifters is designed to output MIDI, Scala, and Wav files, which can then be incorporated into a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). For convenience, I have optimized Sifters around both Ableton Liveâ€™s use of MIDI clips and Serum: Advanced Wavetable Synthesizer's use of WAV files in the construction of wavetables.

## Usage

To use Sifters, create a `Composition` object with the following arguments:

- `sieve`: A string that can be used to initialize a sieve object from the music21 library. This string represents the logical sieve from which musical materials will be derived.

- `grid_set`: A list of fraction objects that define the basic unit of duration for each version of the sieve. If none are provided, Sifters will generate a list of grids based on factors of the sieve's period. This parameter allows users to specify the rhythmic structure or grid divisions for the generated musical materials.

- `normalized_grids`: A boolean value that, if assigned as true, will repeat each `grid_set` so that each grid is the same length. This ensures that all grids have a consistent duration, which can be useful for maintaining rhythmic coherence in the generated musical output.
