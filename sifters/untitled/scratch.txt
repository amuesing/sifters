Choose a Superior Composite Number (60) as the basis for deriving
modulo and indices of sieves. By choosing from the factors of a 
Superior Composite Number, I can organize sieves of differing modulo.

Superior Composite Number are noticable in that they are the lowest
number that have contain an additional number of factors after the
previous Superior Composite Number.

60 has twelve factors:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60
