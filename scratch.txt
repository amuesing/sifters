Thinking of pitch, duration, and probability on a spectrum

Pitch, duration, probability can all be measured by integers between 0 and 1, which sum to 1.
It is possible to represent pitch, duration, and probability with the same transition matrix
where each integer represents a discreet pitch, duration, or probability value.

Pitch can be measured by representing the relationship of fundamental and octave
with 0 as the fundamental and 1 as the octave. Every row of a transition matrix 
cooresponds to pitch based on the resulting frequency when transposed by the frequency of
the fundamental and the octave (2f). It is also possible to use a variable as to what the 
range of 0 to 1 cooresponds to (there can be other, non-octave orientated ways of maping the range).

Duration can be measured by subdividing one cycle of a periodicity. The proportions of each subdivision
can be mapped onto durations that sum to a specified unit of measurment (such as a beat, or measure, or section)
