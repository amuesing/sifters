Thinking of pitch, duration, and probability on a spectrum

Pitch, duration, probability can all be measured by integers between 0 and 1, which sum to 1.
It is possible to represent pitch, duration, and probability with the same transition matrix
where each integer represents a discreet pitch, duration, or probability value.

Pitch can be measured by representing the relationship of fundamental and octave
with 0 as the fundamental and 1 as the octave. Every row of a transition matrix 
cooresponds to pitch based on the resulting frequency when transposed by the frequency of
the fundamental and the octave (2f). It is also possible to use a variable as to what the 
range of 0 to 1 cooresponds to (there can be other, non-octave orientated ways of maping the range).

Duration can be measured by subdividing one cycle of a periodicity. The proportions of each subdivision
can be mapped onto durations that sum to a specified unit of measurment (such as a beat, or measure, or section)

How can I derive temporal distributions from the Sieve?
Expand the pattern out so that one sieve period is one unit of
the temporal distribution of structure.

Track # of repititions
Change pattern based on which # of repitition 

Iannis Xenakis thought of using an 'out of time' logic object at a point of genisis
for music composition. The sieve is way of ordering 

My objective in composing Sifters is to develop tools which serve to portray
nature in its function, and not in its form (cage). Namely by harnessing the power of
ordered chaos, and especially to the extreme degree allowed by digital computing,
I seek to produce a music which seeks
