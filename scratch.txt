# Derive self-similar lists of integers based on the self.changes attribute.
self.form = [[num] * len(self.changes) for num in self.changes]

TO-DO:

1) Consider using phase offset as a modulation source

2) Monophonic, Polyphonic, Nonpitched, Homophonic, and Heterophonic behaviors

3) Consider adding a curve to attack, decay, and release values of the ADSR envelope

4) Develop approach to structure that incoorperates stochastic compositional techniques

5) Create a UI for ease of use with a DAW
