Copy -> Transform -> Combine
MIDI Input -> Texture -> Synthesize MIDI Input and derived texture. Repeat?

Transformers are designed to take the input of a Score Object and transform it.
How to synthesize input MIDI data and Score Object?

Derive Transition Matrix from Score Object. Markov Chains.

What are other transformation techniques?

How to create a Structure Object/Form Object

Sample(MIDI) -> Transform(Texture) -> Combine(MIDI) (-> Sample)

Decomposition and Forecast classes

Can the MIDO library store tempo changes?

Sifters is a collection of analytical processes which are 
designed to deconstruct a MIDI dataset and generate musical compositions
based on probabilistic interpretations of the originating MIDI dataset.

Player class which is similar to Forecast class, emulates a player within a set a musical perameters.

create a dictionary for each note_on message and it's complimentary notes_off 

what if you include a Duration collumn instead of an 'End' Column. Just change End to Duration.
This may be more accurate rendition of the data.
