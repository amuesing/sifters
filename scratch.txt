What is structure?

Silence (rest) -> Something (sound)

Need method to determine time signature

Structure -> Texture -> Transform -> Score

Expand and compress duration for the texture layer that had number of repititions
equal to the sieve's periodicity.

There should be a total duration of the composition. Think of the consecutive_count
as subdivisions of a total time span that all texture layers will total to.

-- What percent of the period is the number of consecutive 
The structure is extracted and repeated a number of times within the Texture class
which is equal to the number of factors within the period of all sieves.

Consider naming the Texture iteration which is equal to the sieves periodicity,
then using the named layer as a primary layer against which the other layers are
developed.

Apply Ligeti concept of density to textures as a point of structure.
